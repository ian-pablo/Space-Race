            On January 2, 1959, the Luna 1 spacecraft was launched towards the Moon by the Soviet Union with the primary goal of being the first human-made object to impact its surface. However, due to an error in the launcher vehicle's guidance system, along with other minor technical problems, it failed to reach the Moon, passing at a perilune (closest point to the Moon) of approximately 6,000 km.
            <br>
            <br>
            As a result, it became the first probe to reach a heliocentric orbit (around the Sun) and was responsible for confirming the existence of solar winds, which are charged particles emitted by the Sun.

        <div id="luna9" class="image textSide" role="img" aria-label="An image of the first probe to land smoothly on the Moon, Luna 9"> </div>
        <p>
            Launched on January 31, 1966, Luna 9 aimed to achieve the first soft landing on the Moon, marking the first time a human-made probe would successfully land on another celestial body. After its three-day journey, Luna 9 activated its retro-thrusters and, with the help of an inflatable cushioning cover (similar to an airbag), safely landed on the lunar surface, transmitting photos and scientific data back to Earth.
            <br>
            <br>
            This mission was significant as it demonstrated the technological feasibility of a lunar landing and disproved the hypothesis that the Moon's surface was covered by a thick layer of fluffy dust, as some theories had suggested.

            "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind." - Neil Armstrong, July 20, 1969, Sea of Tranquility - Moon.
            <br>
            <br>
            On July 16, 1969, the Saturn V rocket successfully launched, placing the Apollo 11 spacecraft into Earth's orbit. After a maneuver, the three-astronaut crew — Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins — embarked on a three-day journey to the Moon. Upon entering lunar orbit, Armstrong and Aldrin transferred to the lunar landing module, named "Eagle," and began the descent to the lunar surface. Using the lunar module's engine to decelerate, they successfully landed in the Sea of Tranquility.
            <br>
            <br>
            On the surface, Neil Armstrong took the first human step on another celestial body, uttering his famous words and planting the United States flag. He and Buzz Aldrin then conducted scientific experiments and collected lunar soil samples before returning to the lunar ascent module. After taking off, they rejoined Michael Collins in the command module in lunar orbit.
            <br>
            <br>
            After the return journey, the crew returned to Earth in another three days, being hailed as heroes in one of humanity's greatest historical milestones.
