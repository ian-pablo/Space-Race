            Dawn Mission
        </h1>
        <div id="dawn" class="image textSide" role="img" aria-label="Image of the Dawn spacecraft in orbit around Ceres"> </div>
        <p>
            The Dawn Mission was launched by NASA on September 27, 2007, with the goal of studying two of the largest bodies in the Asteroid Belt: Vesta and Ceres, with the first classified as an asteroid and the second as a dwarf planet. Dawn was the first spacecraft to orbit two bodies in the Solar System on a single mission. It used an ion propulsion system that, for its time, was very new, with the engine using energy and a tiny amount of xenon gas to generate a small amount of thrust. Despite being small, the engine's efficiency made it capable of achieving a much higher final acceleration compared to conventional engines.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Dawn spacecraft reached Vesta in 2011, where it mapped the asteroid’s surface in great detail, discovering large craters and features suggesting past volcanic activity. In 2015, the mission moved to Ceres, the smallest dwarf planet in the Solar System, revealing incredible discoveries such as salty underground water and a large mountain called Mount Ahuna, which may be an active volcano. The mission was crucial for understanding the composition and evolution of these celestial bodies, and for providing data on the formation of planets in the early Solar System.

            New Horizons Mission
        </h1>
        <div id="newhorizons" class="image textSide" role="img" aria-label="Image of the New Horizons spacecraft on its way to Pluto"> </div>
        <p>
            The New Horizons Mission was launched by NASA on January 19, 2006, with the goal of studying the dwarf planet Pluto and its moons, as well as advancing the study of the Kuiper Belt, a region of the Solar System beyond Neptune. The spacecraft was designed to obtain detailed images and data of Pluto, something unprecedented, as no mission had ever gotten close to Pluto before.
            <br>
            <br>
            New Horizons made history by conducting a flyby of Pluto on July 14, 2015, providing the first detailed close-up of Pluto and its moons. After the successful Pluto flyby, the mission continued toward the Kuiper Belt, where the spacecraft performed a flyby of the object Arrokoth on January 1, 2019, offering important data about the earliest building blocks of the Solar System, as Arrokoth is one of the oldest objects ever visited by a spacecraft.
