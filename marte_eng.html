            First Flyby of Mars

        <p>
            On November 28, 1964, NASA's Mariner 4 spacecraft was launched towards Mars with the mission of conducting the first successful flyby of the Red Planet. The spacecraft's goal was to capture images of Mars' surface and conduct a series of scientific experiments.
            <br>
            <br>
            The images sent back by Mariner 4 had a significant impact, as they revealed that Mars was not a populated planet, as many had believed. Instead, the photos showed a surface covered in craters, something the telescopes of the time could not clearly discern. Additionally, the mission confirmed that Mars' atmosphere was extremely thin, primarily composed of CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide), and that the temperatures on the planet were much colder than expected, dropping to below -50°C.

            First Mars Orbiter

        <div id="mariner9" class="image textSide" role="img" aria-label="An image of the Mariner 9 spacecraft, the first to reach Mars' orbit"> </div>
        <p>
            On May 30, 1971, the Mariner 9 spacecraft was launched by NASA with the goal of becoming the first Mars orbiter. After a nearly six-month journey, it successfully entered Mars' orbit on November 14, 1971, marking a historic achievement in space exploration.
            <br>
            <br>
            Mariner 9's arrival coincided with one of the largest dust storms ever recorded on Mars, which covered nearly the entire surface of the planet. Despite this, the spacecraft remained in orbit until conditions improved, allowing it to send back detailed and groundbreaking images of Mars' surface.
            <br>
            <br>
            In total, the spacecraft mapped about 85% of Mars' surface, providing a valuable foundation for future missions to the Red Planet.

            First Landing on Mars
        </h1>
        <div id="viking" class="image textSide" role="img" aria-label="An image of the Viking 1 landing module, the first spacecraft to successfully land on Mars' surface"> </div>
        <p>
            On August 20, 1975, the Viking 1 spacecraft was launched towards Mars with the goal of conducting the first successful landing on the surface of the Red Planet. After a long journey, Viking 1 arrived at Mars on July 20, 1976, where it separated into two parts: an orbiter, responsible for staying in orbit to collect data and maintain communication with Earth, and a lander, tasked with landing on the surface.
            <br>
            <br>
            The lander employed several stages to ensure a safe descent. First, a heat shield protected its scientific instruments and communication systems from the extreme heat generated during entry into Mars' atmosphere. Next, supersonic parachutes were deployed to reduce its speed. Finally, retro-thrusters were activated near the surface, allowing for a controlled and smooth landing in the Chryse Planitia region.
            <br>
            <br>
            This spacecraft was extremely important, as it conducted various scientific experiments and captured the first detailed photos of Mars' surface. A few weeks later, on September 3, 1976, its twin spacecraft, Viking 2, also successfully landed, this time in the Utopia Planitia region.
