            First Flyby of Mercury

            On November 3, 1973, NASA's Mariner 10 spacecraft was launched towards Venus, where it used a gravity assist from Venus to alter its trajectory and get close to Mercury, which occurred on February 5, 1974. It would officially reach Mercury on March 29, 1974, conducting its first flyby. The spacecraft performed two additional flybys, on September 21, 1974, and March 16, 1975.
            <br>
            <br>
            During its three flybys, Mariner 10 was able to conduct various scientific experiments and map approximately 45% of Mercury's surface. It is important to note that this was the first spacecraft to use gravity assist, a technique that was later used in other missions, such as Voyager 1 and Voyager 2.

            First Orbit and Impact on Mercury
        </h1>
        <div id="messenger" class="image textSide" role="img" aria-label="An image of the MESSENGER spacecraft, the first to orbit and impact Mercury"> </div>
        <p>
            Launched on August 3, 2004, NASA's MESSENGER mission, an acronym for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging, aimed to conduct detailed scientific experiments and map Mercury's surface. To reach Mercury, MESSENGER used six gravity assists: one from Earth, two from Venus, and three from Mercury, until it slowed enough to enter orbit around the planet.
            <br>
            <br>
            After these gravity assists, the spacecraft entered Mercury's orbit on March 18, 2011, seven years after its launch. During its mission, MESSENGER was able to map much of Mercury's surface, confirming the existence of ice-filled craters in permanently shadowed polar regions.
            <br>
            <br>
            After its fuel was depleted, the spacecraft's orbit decayed, and it impacted Mercury's surface on April 30, 2015, becoming the first human-made object to reach the planet's surface.
