            Space Race is an educational website about space exploration, where you can learn about how space missions work in an easier and more interesting way. Space Race features a large collection of illustrative images created by me, the creator, to enhance your experience, as shown in the image where you can see the software I used whitch is Inkscape. It is recommended that as you navigate the website, you follow the sections in the order they appear on the homepage or the options menu in the upper right corner of your screen for a better experience. However, as a user, you are free to skip certain parts and go straight to the ones that interest you the most.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you want, you can learn about the most important space missions that took place in each celestial body of the Solar System <a href="milestones_eng.html"> right here</a>, where you can click on each button to expand the content about each planet.
            <br>
            <br>
            You can also discover more about the biggest catastrophes in space exploration, such as Apollo 1, Soyuz 1, or the Challenger disaster <a href="incidents_eng.html"> right here</a>.
            <br>

        <p>
            Now you might be wondering who I am, right? No? Either way, let me introduce myself. I am Ian, a first-year high school student at ETESP, enrolled in the technical course in system development. This website was created as part of my TCM (Module Conclusion Project) for the technical disciplines, making it a very complex project that encompasses various fields of knowledge.
            <br>
            <br>
            After the entire development process, I can say it was an incredible and fun experience. During the project, I had the chance to practice various skills, such as design (something I'm not very good at), programming (though I didn’t write as many JavaScript files as I wanted), and illustration (where I dared to create all the images and even the mouse pointer to ensure the website's ambiance and visual cohesion were perfect).
            <br>
            <br>
            Despite the challenges, I managed to finish the website since you are reading it fully completed, I hope... Because, as I write this, I still need to translate some parts and finish the Website Identity Manual. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the site because it was a lot of work to make, and I also hope you have fun reading this brief text about me and my site. And, of course... Just seek knowledge... Because the truth is out there! (I hope you got the references...).
