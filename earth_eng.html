            The Start of the Space Race
        </h1>
        <div id="sputinik" class="image textSide" role="img" aria-label="An image of the first artificial satellite of Earth, Sputnik 1"> </div>
        <p>
            To understand the context and reasons behind the start of the Space Race, it is necessary to consider that, during this time, the world was in the midst of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. Both powers, having emerged victorious from World War II, competed for global dominance in various fields, including military, cultural, scientific, and political arenas. 
            <br>
            <br>
            One of the most notable fronts of this conflict was the space race, where both powers invested billions in building spacecraft to demonstrate their technological and military superiority. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The Space Race officially began on October 4, 1957, when the Soviet Union successfully launched the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1. This achievement posed a challenge to the United States, which responded just three months later by launching its own artificial satellite, Explorer 1, successfully reaching orbit as well.

            The First Human in Space
        </h1>
        <div id="vostok" class="image textSide" role="img" aria-label="An image of the first crewed mission to achieve orbit around Earth, Vostok 1, where the legendary cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin was immortalized as the first human in space"> </div>
        <p>
            On April 12, 1961, the Soviet Union once again demonstrated its superiority by sending the first human into orbit, cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, and safely returning him to Earth aboard Vostok 1 after completing one orbit.
            <br>
            <br>
            This marked the beginning of a new era in space exploration—the era of human space exploration, with crewed missions orbiting the planet.
            <br>
            <br>
            Meanwhile, just three weeks later, on May 5, 1961, astronaut Alan Shepard became the first American to reach space aboard the Mercury-Redstone 3 mission, nicknamed Freedom 7. Although he reached space, he did not achieve orbit, as the Redstone launch vehicle used in the mission was not capable of orbital flights. The first American to complete an orbital flight was John Glenn aboard the Mercury-Atlas 6 mission on February 20, 1962, successfully completing three orbits around Earth before safely returning.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is also worth noting that the Soviet Union pioneered again by sending the first woman into space. Cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova was launched on June 16, 1963, aboard the Vostok 6 mission, becoming the first woman to undertake a spaceflight.

            The First Spacewalk
        </h1>
        <div id="voskhod" class="image textSide" role="img" aria-label="An image of Voskhod 2, the first mission to feature a spacewalk around Earth"> </div>
        <p>
            The Soviet Union once again showcased its technological superiority in the Space Race when, on March 18, 1965, cosmonaut Alexei Leonov surprised the world by exiting his capsule to perform the first spacewalk in history. He was aboard the Voskhod 2 capsule along with Pavel Belyayev, who remained inside the spacecraft during the extravehicular activity.
            <br>
            <br>
            The mission was a success and was subsequently broadcast on Soviet television. However, it was not without challenges. Leonov's spacesuit inflated during the spacewalk, nearly trapping him outside the capsule. Fortunately, Leonov managed to partially deflate the suit and, with the help of his companion, returned to the capsule.
            <br>
            <br>
            A few months later, on June 3 of the same year, the United States conducted its own spacewalk during the Gemini 4 mission, where astronaut Ed White performed the first American extravehicular activity. This mission also faced challenges, with several equipment malfunctions causing communication difficulties with mission control and significant inaccuracies during reentry, resulting in the spacecraft landing miles away from the planned recovery zone.

            The First Space Docking
        </h1>
        <div id="gemini" class="image textSide" role="img" aria-label="An image of the Gemini 8 capsule docked to the Agena Target Vehicle"> </div>
        <p>
            After being outpaced in several major achievements by the Soviet Union, the United States successfully conducted the first space docking around Earth on March 16, 1966, during the Gemini 8 mission.
            <br>
            <br>
            The crew consisted of Neil Armstrong and David Scott, and the primary objective was to dock with the Agena Target Vehicle. The mission was successful, but not without issues. Shortly after the docking, a malfunction in the attitude control system of both the Agena module and the Gemini 8 caused the spacecraft to spin uncontrollably. Fortunately, Armstrong stabilized the rotation, averting a catastrophe.
            <br>
            <br>
            Years later, on January 17, 1969, the Soyuz 4 and Soyuz 5 spacecraft performed the Soviet Union's first successful orbital docking maneuver.

            The First Space Station
        </h1>
        <div id="salyut" class="image textSide" role="img" aria-label="An image of the first space station around Earth, the Salyut 1 station"> </div>
        <p>
            The world's first space station was Salyut 1, meaning "salutations" in Russian, launched on April 19, 1971. This station marked the beginning of a new era in space exploration, enabling missions that lasted months instead of days or weeks. This capability is crucial for studying the prolonged effects of microgravity on humans, paving the way for long-term missions to other planets, such as a possible crewed mission to Mars.
            <br>
            <br>
            On the American side, an equivalent station named Skylab was launched on May 14, 1973. Skylab enabled numerous scientific experiments, advancing knowledge about space and astronaut health during extended missions.

            Rockets with Reusable Stages
        </h1>
        <div id="falcon" class="image textSide" role="img" aria-label="An image of the first stage of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, the first rocket with a fully reusable stage"> </div>
        <p>
            Decades after the end of the Space Race, on December 21, 2015, the first stage of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, developed by Elon Musk's aerospace company, landed safely on solid ground at Landing Zone 1 in Cape Canaveral, Florida. By reigniting some of its Merlin engines, it achieved a controlled vertical descent, marking the beginning of a new era of more accessible space travel. Months later, on April 8, 2016, SpaceX successfully landed the first stage on a floating platform in the Atlantic Ocean, proving the technology's viability in various conditions.
            <br>
            <br>
            These achievements significantly reduced the cost of delivering payloads to low Earth orbit and shortened the time between missions. With the reusable first stage, it can be employed in multiple missions, reducing production costs and minimizing the time needed for rebuilding, thereby drastically cutting the intervals between launches.
