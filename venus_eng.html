            First Flyby of Venus
        </h1>
        <div id="mariner" class="image textSide" role="img" aria-label="Image of the Mariner 2 spacecraft, the first to flyby Venus"> </div>
        <p>
            On August 27, 1962, NASA's Mariner 2 spacecraft was launched with the goal of conducting the first flyby of Venus. The spacecraft passed within about 34,800 km of the planet's surface on December 14 of the same year, becoming the first successful mission to flyby Venus.
            <br>
            <br>
            During its flyby, Mariner 2 made important discoveries about the planet, revealing that Venus has extremely high temperatures, exceeding 500°C, and a dense atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide. The spacecraft also confirmed the presence of thick clouds and extremely high atmospheric pressure on the surface. These observations helped to refute some earlier theories that suggested Venus might be a more habitable planet. It is worth noting that these measurements were made indirectly through instruments aboard the spacecraft.
            <br>
            <br>
            This was the first successful interplanetary mission in history, marking an important milestone in space exploration.

            First Landing on Venus' Surface
        </h1>
        <div id="venera_land" class="image textSide" role="img" aria-label="Image of the Venera 7 spacecraft landing on Venus' surface"> </div>
        <p>
            On August 7, 1970, the Soviet Union's Venera 7 mission was launched towards Venus, with the goal of achieving the first successful landing on another planet. The spacecraft arrived at Venus on December 15, 1970. It was made of a highly resistant material to withstand the tremendous temperatures and pressures of Venus' atmosphere, which had caused the failure of the previous mission, Venera 6. The spacecraft was also covered with a heat shield for atmospheric entry and had a parachute to slow it down as it neared the surface.
            <br>
            <br>
            Everything was going well; the spacecraft deployed its parachute and was slowing down, when the parachute ripped in half, and the spacecraft hit the surface at high speed. However, by great luck, the spacecraft survived and managed to transmit data for 23 minutes back to Earth, though with a very weak signal, as the spacecraft's antenna was positioned at an unfavorable angle for communication with Earth.

            First Orbit of Venus
        </h1>
        <div id="venera_orbity" class="image textSide" role="img" aria-label="Image of the Venera 9 mission orbiter, the first spacecraft to successfully orbit Venus"> </div>
        <p>
            Launched on June 8, 1975, aboard the Proton-K rocket, the Venera 9 mission consisted of an orbiter and a lander. After a few months of travel, both successfully reached Venus on October 22, 1975, with the orbiter remaining in orbit and the lander touching down on the planet's surface.
            <br>
            <br>
            With the success of the orbiter, it was able to retransmit scientific data acquired by the lander and map a large portion of Venus' surface topography. This achievement was made possible thanks to radar, as the planet's dense atmosphere prevents observation of the surface in visible light.
