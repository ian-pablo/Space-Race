            On September 5 and August 20, 1977, the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft were launched, respectively, with the goal of taking advantage of a gravity assist opportunity that would allow the two spacecraft to flyby Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, using the minimum amount of fuel.
            <br>
            <br>
            Voyager 1 flew by only Jupiter and Saturn, but after its flyby of Saturn, it took a trajectory that led it into interstellar space, where it arrived on August 25, 2012, becoming the first human-made object to enter interstellar space. Voyager 2, on the other hand, continued towards Uranus and then Neptune. After these encounters, it also entered a trajectory out of the Solar System, leaving on November 5, 2018.
            <br>
            <br>
            Both spacecraft played essential roles in space exploration, conducting various scientific experiments on the gas giant planets and mapping their moons.

            Juno Mission

            NASA's Juno mission was launched on August 5, 2011, with the goal of studying Jupiter in detail, focusing mainly on its atmosphere, magnetic field, composition, and internal structure. The Juno spacecraft uses state-of-the-art instruments to gather data that help scientists better understand the formation of the planet and the Solar System as a whole.
            <br>
            <br>
            Juno arrived at Jupiter on July 4, 2016, and began a series of elliptical orbits around the planet. Some of its most important discoveries include observations of intense atmospheric storms, including the Great Red Spot, as well as information on Jupiter's magnetic field and its internal structure. The mission continues to provide valuable data about the nature of Jupiter and the mysteries that still surround the largest planet in the Solar System.

            Galileo Mission
        </h1>
        <div id="galileo" class="image textSide" role="img" aria-label="An image of the Galileo atmospheric probe entering Jupiter's atmosphere"> </div>
        <p>
            Launched on October 18, 1989, the Galileo spacecraft was the first mission dedicated to the study of Jupiter and its moons. The mission aimed to explore the giant planet and its various moons, such as Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, as well as studying Jupiter's magnetic field and atmosphere.
            <br>
            <br>
            The spacecraft carried a special module called the Atmospheric Probe, designed to enter Jupiter's atmosphere. On July 12, 1995, the probe was released and began its journey towards the planet's atmosphere. On December 7, 1995, it plunged into Jupiter's upper atmosphere, transmitting data for 58 minutes before being destroyed due to the extreme temperatures and pressures. This probe collected valuable information about Jupiter's atmosphere, revealing that it is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with traces of methane, ammonia, and water vapor.
            <br>
            <br>
            During its orbit around Jupiter, Galileo made significant discoveries about the planet and its moons, including volcanic activity on Io and the possibility of a subsurface ocean on Europa. The Galileo mission ended on September 21, 2003, when NASA deliberately destroyed the spacecraft in Jupiter's atmosphere to avoid any risk of contamination on Europa, a moon that might have conditions capable of sustaining life in its subsurface ocean.
